A disadvantage to using floating point arithmetic vs fixed point arithmetic is that floating point is not as fast and is more computationally demanding. An advantage to using
floating point arithmetic over fixed point arithmetic is that floating point arithmetic is more flexibile and can represent a wider range of values when compared to fixed
point arithmetic.
