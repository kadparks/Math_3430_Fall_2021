Question 01:

A neat computing project to work on in the future for myself would be a simple computer game. This game would most likely just be run through a browser, and not feature
and overly complex mechanics. I very much enjoy PC gaming and gaming on multiple platforms in general, so creating my own computer game, however simple, would be pretty 
rewarding to do. Then I would also be able to gain ad revenue from my site and earn some extra income.
